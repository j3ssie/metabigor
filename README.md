# What is Metabigor?

Metabigor is Intelligence tool, its goal is to do OSINT tasks and more but without any API key.

# Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

You can download pre-built binaries for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/j3ssie/metabigor/releases). Choose the appropriate binary for your operating system and architecture, download it, and place it in your `PATH`. 

If the binary fails to execute, consider incorporating this into your environment: `export ASSUME_NO_MOVING_GC_UNSAFE_RISK_IT_WITH=go1.20`.

### Building from Source

To install this project from source, you'll need Go installed on your system. If you haven't installed Go yet, you can follow the official installation instructions [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/j3ssie/metabigor.git
cd metabigor
go install
```


# Main features

- Searching information about IP Address, ASN and Organization.
- Wrapper for running rustscan, masscan and nmap more efficient on IP/CIDR.
- Finding more related domains of the target by applying various techniques (certificate, whois, Google Analytics, etc).
- Get Summary about IP address (powered by [**@thebl4ckturtle**](https://github.com/theblackturtle))

# Usage

## Discovery IP of a company/organization - `metabigor net`

The difference between net and **netd** command is that **netd** will get the dynamic result from the third-party source
while net command will get the static result from the database.

```bash
# discovery IP of a company/organization
echo "company" | metabigor net --org -o /tmp/result.txt

# discovery IP of an ASN
echo "ASN1111" | metabigor net --asn -o /tmp/result.txt
cat list_of_ASNs | metabigor net --asn -o /tmp/result.txt

echo "ASN1111" | metabigor netd --asn -o /tmp/result.txt
```

*** 

## Finding more related domains of the target by applying various techniques (certificate, whois, Google Analytics, etc) - `metabigor related`

> Note some of the results are not 100% accurate. Please do a manual check first before put it directly to other tools
> to scan.

Some specific technique require different input so please see the usage of each technique.

## Using certificate to find related domains on crt.sh

```bash
# Getting more related domains by searching for certificate info
echo 'Target Inc' | metabigor cert --json | jq -r '.Domain' | unfurl format %r.%t | sort -u # this is old command

# Getting more related domains by searching for certificate info
echo 'example Inc' | metabigor related -s 'cert'
```

## Wrapper for running rustscan, masscan and nmap more efficient on IP/CIDR - `metabigor scan`

This command will require you to install `masscan`, `rustscan` and `nmap` first or at least the pre-scan result of them.

```bash
# Only run rustscan with full ports
echo '1.2.3.4/24' | metabigor scan -o result.txt

# Only run nmap detail scan based on pre-scan data
echo '1.2.3.4:21' | metabigor scan -s
cat list_of_ip_with_port.txt | metabigor scan -c 10 --8 -s -o result.txt
cat list_of_ip_with_port.txt | metabigor scan -c 10 --tmp /tmp/raw-result/ -s -o result.txt
echo '1.2.3.4 -> [80,443,2222]' | metabigor scan -R

# Run rustscan with full ports and nmap detail scan based on pre-scan data
echo '1.2.3.4/24' | metabigor scan --pipe | metabigor scan -R 
```

***

## Using Reverse Whois to find related domains

```bash
echo 'example.com' | metabigor related -s 'whois'
```

## Getting more related by searching for Google Analytics ID

```bash
# Get it directly from the URL
echo 'https://example.com' | metabigor related -s 'google-analytic'

# You can also search it directly from the UA ID too
metabigor related -s 'google-analytic' -i 'UA-9152XXX' --debug
```

*** 

## Get Summary about IP address (powered by [**@thebl4ckturtle**](https://github.com/theblackturtle)) - `metabigor ipc`

This will show you the summary of the IP address provided like ASN, Organization, Country, etc.

```bash
cat list_of_ips.txt | metabigor ipc --json
```

## Extract Shodan IPInfo from internetdb.shodan.io

```bash
echo '1.2.3.4' | metabigor ip -open
1.2.3.4:80
1.2.3.4:443

# lookup CIDR range
echo '1.2.3.4/24' | metabigor ip -open -c 20
1.2.3.4:80
1.2.3.5:80

# get raw JSON response
echo '1.2.3.4' | metabigor ip -json
```
